# vue-financial-app
This is a financial app I made with vue.js as a first exercise.

# Functionality
- Add and delete expenses
- View expenses in a table, sorted by date
- Expenses consist of: date, description and a value

- Save your expenses to a .json file
- Load expenses from a previously saved .json file
- Print the table without the user interface
